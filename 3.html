  <h2>Guard</h2>
  <p>A combo guard is a basketball player who combines the attributes of a point guard (1) and shooting guard (2), but does not necessarily fit the standard description of either position. Such guards are usually within the 6' 2" (1.88 m) and 6' 4" (1.93 m) height range. Most combo guards tend to be between point and shooting guards in terms of height although some possess height of a point or shooting guard specifically which effects how each guard plays (taller guards tend to go inside more and get more rebounds, for instance.</p>
